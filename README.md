## 🌿 Hi, I'm @AbUndMax
- I have a degree in Biology with specialization in plant-physiology 🧬.
### 🎈 So what am I doing here?
- A few years ago I went into first coding experiences with python. With growing experiences and joy I started a Master in Bioinformatics.

### 💻 My experiences:
-  I’m still learning! especially in Data Science!
-  But I have good coding knowledge in Java☕️ and Python🐍

### </> What`s to see here?
- My most recent project to make parsing command line arguments in Java a little bit easier with a [Java_ArgsParser](https://github.com/AbUndMax/Java_ArgsParser)
- You can find my very first coding projects in Java and Racket like a [Calculator](https://github.com/AbUndMax/JAVA-Calculator), a [cat hunting your mous game](https://github.com/AbUndMax/cat-hunts-food-Racket-Minigame) or a [Towers of Hanoi minigame](https://github.com/AbUndMax/Towers-Of-Hanoi-JavaGame)
- But also some of my first bigger projects like an [Organizer](https://github.com/AbUndMax/Organizer-App_Java-swing)
- And finally my first steps in Bioinformatics with a [DNA-Complementary App](https://github.com/AbUndMax/DNA-Complementary-App) up to a simple [SNV-caller](https://github.com/AbUndMax/SNVcaller)
