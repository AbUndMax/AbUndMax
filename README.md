## üåø Hi, I'm @AbUndMax
- I have a degree in Biology with specialization in plant-physiology üß¨.
### üéà So what am I doing here?
- A few years ago I went into first coding experiences with python. With growing experiences and joy I started a Master in Bioinformatics.

### üíª My experiences:
-  I‚Äôm still learning! especially in Data Science!
-  But I have good coding knowledge in Java‚òïÔ∏è and Pythonüêç

### </> What`s to see here?
- My most recent project [BodyParts3D Anatomy Explorer](https://github.com/AbUndMax/BodyParts3D_Anatomy_Explorer) which uses JavaFX to create a native application for interactive exploration of the human body using assets and concept from *Mitsuhashi et al.*.
- A package to make parsing command line arguments in Java a little bit easier with a [Java_ArgsParser](https://github.com/AbUndMax/Java_ArgsParser)
- You can find my very first coding projects in Java and Racket like a [Calculator](https://github.com/AbUndMax/JAVA-Calculator), a [cat hunting your mous game](https://github.com/AbUndMax/cat-hunts-food-Racket-Minigame) or a [Towers of Hanoi minigame](https://github.com/AbUndMax/Towers-Of-Hanoi-JavaGame)
- But also some of my first bigger projects like an [Organizer](https://github.com/AbUndMax/Organizer-App_Java-swing)
- My first steps in Bioinformatics with a [DNA-Complementary App](https://github.com/AbUndMax/DNA-Complementary-App), a simple [SNV-caller](https://github.com/AbUndMax/SNVcaller) or a basic [ChIP-seq peak-caller](https://github.com/AbUndMax/ChIP-seq_peak-caller).
- My most advanced bioinformatics project yet, implementing a [progressive alignment program for MSAs](https://github.com/AbUndMax/progressiveAligner)
- Or other helpful stuff like a [CSV-Comparator](https://github.com/AbUndMax/CSVcomparator-Batch-Program) or simple [loading animations for CLI-python-](https://github.com/AbUndMax/loadpy) or [java-scripts](https://github.com/AbUndMax/HoldMyCoffee)
